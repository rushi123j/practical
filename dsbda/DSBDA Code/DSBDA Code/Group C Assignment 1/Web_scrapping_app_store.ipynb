No longer easy to see all unread messages in one place - which was a feature I regularly requested for the desktop app. Now, the iPad app has been turned to be quite bland. Seems like the “Dark Mode” folks won the design argument; as the new app no longer supports the desktop or web app color themes; which now makes the iPad app incredibly difficult to know at a glance which team you’re viewing. Also frustrating are the 3 or so “Unread Direct Messages” you can see, when you tap “Show All” it takes you to the “Direct Messages” sidebar that sorts in its own way, with unreads strewn about. Also, Direct message addresses are much harder to read; too much text all clumped together. Unfortunate for the iPad app, Slack has taken a once very useful version (preferred as a second screen in some cases over the desktop app) and made it into a giant iPhone app. The iPhone app now also suffers from this Direct Message unread messages “Show All” problem. The only way to return some of the missing sort and see all DMs on the iPad app is to select the sort option of “by recent” but it does not group unreads. 7 years using Slack, and this is by far the most disappointing iPad app “upgrade.” Repackage the desktop app for the iPad and call it “Slack Pro” for iPad Pro users who use their iPad in place of a laptop.',\n",

Now with the acquisition from salesforce, I truly feel like Slack is going to go down the drain and what was once the industry leader in communication has sat back on the couch, slacking, watching everybody else move forward. As of today, we are looking into other platforms outside of Slack due to the lack of innovation and buy out from sales force. An example of what I think is easy innovative feedback, we’ve been asking for voice clips to send both privately and in channels up to 2 to 5 minutes long so managers can leave a status update or important message or daily briefing first thing in the morning without having to type it all out and can do it on the go; nothing.

The ability to create channels within a group, the self DM feature (where you can set reminders, write notes, etc.), and the intuitive design make this app superior to other group messaging apps. Joining multiple very large groups and keeping files, conversations, and sub-groups so well organized within those groups is nothing short of amazing.',\n",

This works well in the desktop app. However, the iOS app insists on pushing channels with unread messages to the top of the list. If a section contains channels that have unread messages and channels without unreadable, it shows the section twice. You’ll see the section once near the top, showing only the channels with unreads, and again at the bottom, with the rest of the channels. The effect is to make sections almost unusable. Important channels are never where you expect to find them, and things that you try to group together are constantly being shuffled into two different locations.',\n",

Isn’t it a basic rule of app and UI/UX design to avoid making the user tap and click extra to get to the good stuff?\\n\\nThere’s no paywall, so why change the nature of how Slack loads and what screen it loads to? Why add extra steps for the user to get where they want to go?\\n\\nI otherwise really like Slack; I like making custom emojis, and it’s become a major messaging app for me and friends.\\n\\nHowever, 1-star for Slack adding “more sifting through and clicking and waiting for things to load then clicking into names” every time. It’s a totally unnecessary frustration.\\n\\nAlso, intermittent glitches on iOS that don’t seem to read a long press on the most recently sent message, and sometimes just one in a batch of messages; any reason for this? It’s a new iOS problem in 2020.',\n",
